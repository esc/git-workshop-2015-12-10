=======================

Repository for the git-workshop on 2015-12-10

TODO
----

There are many paths this workshop can take. Here are some ideas:

#. Obtain commit-access to the main repo

#. Create a file ``hello_myname.py`` for yourself to work on

#. Use push and pull workflow on master with merge

#. Use push and pull workflow on master with rebase

#. Fork the repository

#. Use the github-flow workflow (feature branches and pull-requests)
